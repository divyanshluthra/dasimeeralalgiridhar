# Daasi Meera Lal Giridhar
The term "Dāsi Meerā Lāl Giridhar" describes the divine & unique Mādhurya(couple) based relationship which Meerābāi and Bhagwān Krishna(God) have. Meerā is the dāsi(servant), and Giridhar(the one who lifted the hill named Govardhan on his little finger to protect all residents of Vrindāvan) ie Krishna is her beloved master who is more dear to her than her own life. For Krishna's love, Meerā gave up everything-- her family, wealth, desires, decorating ornaments, and ultimately, her heart. For Meerā, Krishna is her Lāl(her dearest). 
The app is a collection of the poems and songs sung by her. I have collected these from various authentic sources. I (and anyone, infact) cannot claim that I have all her pad (poems) that she sang, but I have made an honest effort to bring forth to you these divine heart-crushing poems. They are originally in old Rajasthani languages like Mevāti, Mārvādi etc, but some are in Gujrāti & have Punjābi influence too. 
The app includes these poems and their purport for better understanding of her feelings. Everyday, at 8PM as per your local time zone no matter where you are in the world, you will receive one pad(poem) and it's purport.
